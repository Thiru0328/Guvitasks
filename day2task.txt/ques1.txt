write a blog on the Difference between Document and Window Objects

THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.

The document object is the root node of the HTML document.

The document object is a property of the window object and it is the child for window object

By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
 
With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page.

The document object is accessed with:

eg:- window.document or just document


The following properties and methods can be used on HTML documents:

activeElement	-Returns the currently focused element in the document
addEventListener()	-Attaches an event handler to the document
adoptNode()	-Adopts a node from another document
baseURI -	Returns the absolute base URI of a document
body-	Sets or returns the document's body (the <body> element)
head-	Returns the <head> element of the document
images-	Returns a collection of all <img> elements in the document
implementation-	Returns the DOMImplementation object that handles this document
importNode()-	Imports a node from another document
getElementById()-	Returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value


WINDOW OBJECT

The window object represents an open window in a browser.

If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document,
 and one additional window object for each frame.

 The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy.

 eg:- window.property_name;

 The properties of Window objects that are commonly used are listed in the below:-

 Closed- It holds a Boolean value that represents whether the window is closed or not.
 console- It returns a reference to the console object 
 which provides access to the browserâ€™s debugging console.
 History- It provides information on the URLs visited in the current window
 Screen-Returns the Screen object for the window See also The Screen object
 localStorage-Allows to save key/value pairs in a web browser. Stores the data with no expiration date
