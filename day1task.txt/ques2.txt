//write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript

Objects are important data types in javascript.
Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods,
 respectively, in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'MAHINDRA ';

myCar.model = 'XUV';

myCar.year = 2011;

myCar.wheels = 4;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

myCar.year

Output: 2011

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

myCar[year]

Output: 2011

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :

ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is
 “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”

Object Methods
 An object method is an object property containing a function definition
 i.e.,

Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality
and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.
So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script Object methods is
 “Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.”
 function(){return ignition.on}

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor
 Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, 
 constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below
 function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
console.log(car1.name); o/p 'Ford'

OBJECT EXAMPLE:
The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “Thiru”;
person.lastName = “wissen”;
person.age = 28;
person.eyeColor = “black”
